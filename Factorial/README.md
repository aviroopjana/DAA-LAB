# âœ¨ Factorial using recursion

Factorial is a mathematical operation that calculates the product of all positive integers up to a given number.

 ðŸ‘‰ <strong>Here's a concise explanation of calculating the factorial of a number using recursion:</strong>

- If the input is 0 or 1, return 1 as the factorial value (base case).
- Otherwise, recursively call the factorial function with the input number minus 1.
- Multiply the input number by the result of the recursive call.
- Return the product as the factorial of the given input.

The recursive factorial algorithm breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems by reducing the input number by 1 in each recursive call. By multiplying the current number with the factorial of the number minus 1, it calculates the factorial value for a given input.

ðŸ’­ Through recursion, the factorial of a number can be computed in a concise and elegant manner, providing a clear and intuitive solution to finding the factorial value.
